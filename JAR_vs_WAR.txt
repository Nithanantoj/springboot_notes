JAR vs WAR
==========

🔎 What is a JAR?
-----------------
JAR (Java ARchive) is a package file format that bundles:
✅ Compiled `.class` files
✅ Configuration files
✅ Resources (like images, property files, etc.)

In Spring Boot, a JAR file contains an embedded web server (like Tomcat or Jetty) and can be executed directly using:
java -jar myapp.jar


✅ Advantages of JAR
--------------------
✔️ Self-contained – Includes an embedded server, no need for external configuration.
✔️ Simplified deployment – Deploy directly as a standalone application.
✔️ Faster startup – Optimized for microservices and cloud-based deployments.
✔️ Easier to manage – Can be built once and run anywhere with `java -jar`.


❌ Disadvantages of JAR
-----------------------
❌ Less flexibility for deploying in existing application servers.
❌ Larger file size due to embedded server.


🔎 What is a WAR?
-----------------
WAR (Web Application Archive) is a package format designed for deployment in a servlet container (like Tomcat or JBoss).
WAR files don’t include the server; they need to be deployed to an external server.


✅ Advantages of WAR
--------------------
✔️ Flexible deployment – Can be deployed in existing servlet containers.
✔️ Easier to manage – If you already have a centralized server, WAR is easier to manage.
✔️ Better separation of concerns – Web server and application are separate.


❌ Disadvantages of WAR
-----------------------
❌ Requires an external servlet container.
❌ More complex to deploy and manage compared to JAR files.
❌ Not suitable for microservices architecture.


🔥 Key Differences
------------------
| Feature                | JAR                              | WAR                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Contains               | Application + Embedded Server    | Application only                 |
| Execution              | `java -jar` (standalone)         | Deploy in external server        |
| Startup Time           | Faster (embedded server)         | Slower (depends on server)       |
| Flexibility            | Independent deployment            | Requires servlet container       |
| Best For               | Microservices, Cloud apps         | Enterprise apps, Monolithic apps |
| Size                   | Larger (includes server)          | Smaller                          |


🏆 When to Use JAR vs WAR
-------------------------
| Use Case                       | Best Choice                                      |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Microservices                   | JAR (due to independence and quick startup)       |
| Cloud Deployment                | JAR                                              |
| Standalone Apps                 | JAR                                              |
| Monolithic Apps                 | WAR                                              |
| Existing Application Servers    | WAR                                              |
| Traditional Enterprise Deployment| WAR                                              |


🚀 Conclusion:
-------------
👉 JAR is best for:
✅ Microservices
✅ Cloud-based and containerized apps (like Docker)
✅ Independent and fast deployment

👉 WAR is best for:
✅ Traditional enterprise applications
✅ Deploying to centralized or shared servlet containers
✅ Apps that need to work with existing infrastructure

👉 JAR is more common for Spring Boot projects due to its simplicity and flexibility. ✅
